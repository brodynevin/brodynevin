Hi, I’m Brody Nevin
---
I grew up in Round Rock, Texas, and graduated from Round Rock High School. I achieved the Eagle Scout rank in February 2020. Around then I was accepted and received a full-ride scholarship to the University of Mississippi. I hope to enter the field of data science as I complete my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.

You can find me on Linkedin [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brodynevin/)
